**Title** 
Breast Cancer Data Analysis

**Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data using machine learning techniques to predict the diagnosis (benign or malignant) based on various features of cell nuclei. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation using Logistic Regression.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. It contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells. Each sample has 30 features describing the characteristics of the cell nuclei.

**Installation**
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

. pandas
. numpy
. matplotlib
. seaborn
. scikit-learn

**Data Preprocessing**

Load and clean the data.
Handle missing values.
Generate descriptive statistics.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

Plot histograms, pairplots, and correlation heatmaps to understand data distribution and relationships.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a Logistic Regression model.
Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

**Feature Importance**

Plot feature importance to identify key predictors.

**Results**

Achieved 94% accuracy.
Detailed evaluation with confusion matrix and classification report.
